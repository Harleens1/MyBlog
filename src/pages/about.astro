      <p>
        I am a software developer with a passion for the web.  
        When I am not coding I enjoy watching sports (mainly basketball), Call of Duty and talk about it on the internet. 
        If you have read one of my blog post and would like to talk, hit me up on Linkedin. I am always more than 
        happy to talk with people!
