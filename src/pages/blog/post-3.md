I love movies. They are one of my favorites form of entertainment. Unfortunately they are also very expensive. I do not go that often, but I will go if it is a hyped up release and it interests me. 

## Dune part 2

The first movie I watched. I found the first part dissapointing. I was bored for most of it and I did not like many of the characters. I was also very confused at times with the world. But after seeing how well received the second part was i bought a ticket and decided to see for myself. Of course I also did some reserach on the world of Dune so i was not as confused as when I watched part 1. 

Overall, I loved it. I think it was a non stop ride, and I enjoyed every moment. I still do not find any of the main characters intriguing, but the plot kept me hooked anyway. I am now very excited for the future entries. 

## Kung fu Panad 4 

I went to watch this my cousins who are kids. I was very dissapointed, it is the weakest Kung Fu Panad movie so far and the most kid like it has felt. I think the villain was terrible and bringing back old villains was not necessary at all. Furthermore the furious fives were absent and replaced by a new character which i found quite annoying. 

I would not watch again, unlike the first two which i think are masterpeices. It is sad that Kung Fu Panad has not been able to reach those heights.

## Inside out 2 

Once again I was intruiged by the good reviews online. I am a huge Pixar fan, but I actually have not watched the first inside out. Still I decided to give it a watch and it was really good. I love the message of the movie and I would highly reccomend anyone with kids to go watch it with them. Pixar just does not miss. Even their weakest entries are still enjoyable.
