## An historic organization

In the realm of competitive Call of Duty, the CDL or call of duty league, stands as the pinnacle of the esport. A franchised league like Overwatch, it is made up of 12 teams that battle it out each year to in multiple stages and a championship at the end of the year. I started watching call of duty, or COD back in 2016 with Black Ops 3 and i have been hooked on it ever since. I am someone that prefers following players over teams, so I have rooted for multiple different teams througout. I am now a bif New York Subliners fan. 

Team History and Origins:

The New York Subliners, owned by Andbox, entered the Call of Duty League in its inaugural season in 2020.
Rooted in the rich esports culture of New York City, the team represents resilience, determination, and a commitment to excellence. They have been competitive every year of the CDL so far and even won the Championship in 2023.

The roster of the New York Subliners this year is made up of Hydra, Sib, Kismet and Skyz. They have actually made a roster change after winning the championship in 2023. They brought in Sib for Priestah. This move was for obvious reasons quite controversial at that time, but every team around was making changes to get better so to be left behind they dropped their weakest player for a rising star on Sib who had become a free agent after two years with Seattle Surge. 

This year they started out very slow, as slow as you can possibly get. They placed dead last at the first major tournament. This was shocking to many, as they were of course the world champions and were supposed to have gotten even better. They bounced back with a 3rd place finish on major 2 and a 4h place on major 3. 
Not bad placings by any means, but anything but a finals appereance was a dissapointment for this roster and many had started to count them out. 


## Victory at last 

Finally at major 4 they were able to come out victourious upsetiing Atlanta Faze in the finals. The major started out really bac actually as they suffered a loss in the first round to the same Atlanta Faze, but the team never weaverd and fought back for 3 days to make it to the finals for a rematch vs Faze. Faze were at that point, the best team in the world, many people thought NYSL would be made quikc work of. But an impressive perfomamce by their X factor Kismet propelled them to victory. Givin the organization another trophy for the cabinet. 

Now all sights are set on the Championship to see if they can defend their title.
